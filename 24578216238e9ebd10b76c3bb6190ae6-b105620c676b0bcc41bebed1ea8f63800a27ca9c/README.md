This program is a simple simulation of four agents giving each other credits.

This example shows you some of the basic Java concepts such as public & private member variables, passing _this_ as an argument, and the difference between  ``this.variable`` and ``variable``.

You can compile it using ``javac Agent.java Simulation.java`` and run it using ``java Simulation``.
